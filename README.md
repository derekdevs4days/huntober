Hey all! Welcome to the first day of my first week of daily web dev challenges this October üéÉ.

These challenges are designed to be a bit of fun mixed with a bit of coding practice. Beginning each Saturday, the daily tasks will build towards discovering a final solution the following Friday. If that sounds like something you want in on, welcome!

‚≠ê Here's how it works
Each week will have a cumulative goal
Each day I'll write a post with the challenge of the day
Check my Huntober Twitter for updates (and possible hints)
Save your code and solution from day to day! The challenges are cumulative
Please don't spoil it for everyone and share your answers without spoiler warnings
I'll share my approach and solutions each week
Have fun and maybe even learn some tricks
